# Vorlesung- A virtual classroom application

This project has been developed for the Microsoft Engage Program 2021.The main motivation behind this project is to make remote teaching and learning easier. It helps teachers create classes and share assignments and lectures with the students. It also has a discussion forum to encourage interaction between the students and their teachers. Everytime, an assignment or  a lecture is created, all the students enrolled in the class get notified via email.

## Limitations and Further Improvements

- Currently, only 200 emails per month can be sent(because of subscription limits). Email notifications can be included for other events (like notifying the teacher when a student submits an assignment) in the future.

- Firebase hosting limits- Can handle 10K requests per month.

- Firebase database limits and storage limits.

- App can be further optimised by caching resources that are not changed frequently.
