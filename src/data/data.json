      "paragraph": "Hi, my name is Rhea Sharma and I am a mentee at Microsoft Engage 2021. I developed this website as a part of the Engage Challenge in a period of roughly 3 weeks. The main motivation behind this project is to make remote teaching and learning easier. Through this tool, a user can create a class, and share the class ID to enable other users to join the class. In a class, the creator can share lectures, so that the students can join them. The classroom participants can discuss about various topics in the discussion forum. Also, the creator can create assignments and the students can submit it.",
